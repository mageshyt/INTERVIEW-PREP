"""
Problem Statement: Given a grid of size NxM (N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns in the grid) consisting of '0's (Water) and â€˜1's(Land). Find the number of islands.

Note: An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically or diagonally i.e., in all 8 directions.
