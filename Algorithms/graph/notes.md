## 1. Problem Solved:
* Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph (non-negative edge weights).
* Prim’s Algorithm: Finds the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph, which connects all nodes in a graph with the minimum possible total edge weight without any cycles.

## 2. Type of Problem:
*	Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Single-source shortest path problem.
*	Prim’s Algorithm: Minimum spanning tree (MST) problem.

## 3. Goal:

* Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Minimize the total path weight from a starting node to each other node.
* Prim’s Algorithm: Minimize the total edge weight of the tree that spans all nodes.

## 4. Algorithm Approach:

* Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Expands outward from the starting node, picking the node with the smallest known distance from the source at each step.
* Prim’s Algorithm: Expands the tree by adding the smallest possible edge that connects a node in the tree to a node not yet in the tree.
